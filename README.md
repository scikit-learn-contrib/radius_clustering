# Radius Clustering

Radius clustering is a Python package that implements clustering under radius constraint based on the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem. This problem is NP-Hard but has been studied in the literature and proven to be linked to the clustering under radius constraint problem (see [references](#references) for more details).

## Features

- Implements both exact and approximate MDS-based clustering algorithms
- Compatible with scikit-learn's API for clustering algorithms
- Supports radius-constrained clustering
- Provides options for exact and approximate solutions
- Easy to use and integrate with existing Python data science workflows
- Includes comprehensive documentation and examples
- Full test coverage to ensure reliability and correctness
- Supports custom MDS solvers for flexibility in clustering approaches
- Provides a user-friendly interface for clustering tasks

> [!CAUTION]
> **Deprecation Notice**: The `threshold` parameter in the `RadiusClustering` class has been deprecated. Please use the `radius` parameter instead for specifying the radius for clustering. It is planned to be completely removed in version 2.0.0. The `radius` parameter is now the standard way to define the radius for clustering, aligning with our objective of making the parameters' name more intuitive and user-friendly.

> [!NOTE]
> **NEW VERSIONS**: The package is currently under active development for new features and improvements, including some refactoring and enhancements to the existing codebase. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed, so please check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details on changes and updates.

## Roadmap

- [x] Version 1.4.0:
    - [x] Add support for custom MDS solvers
    - [x] Improve documentation and examples
    - [x] Add more examples and tutorials

## Installation

You can install Radius Clustering using pip:

```bash
pip install radius-clustering
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Radius Clustering:

```python
import numpy as np
from radius_clustering import RadiusClustering

# Example usage
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # Generate random data

# Create an instance of MdsClustering
rad_clustering = RadiusClustering(manner="approx", radius=0.5)

# Fit the model to the data
rad_clustering.fit(X)

# Get cluster labels
labels = rad_clustering.labels_

print(labels)
```

## Documentation

You can find the full documentation for Radius Clustering [here](https://lias-laboratory.github.io/radius_clustering/).

### Building the documentation

To build the documentation, you can run the following command, assuming you have all dependencies needed installed:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

Then you can open the `index.html` file in the `build` directory to view the full documentation.

## More information

For more information please refer to the official documentation.

### MDS Algorithms

The two MDS algorithms implemented are forked and modified (or rewritten) from the following authors:

- [Alejandra Casado](https://github.com/AlejandraCasado) for the minimum dominating set heuristic code [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475422005055)]. We rewrote the code in C++ to adapt to the need of python interfacing.
- [Hua Jiang](https://github.com/huajiang-ynu) for the minimum dominating set exact algorithm code [[2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.24963/ijcai.2023/622)]. The code has been adapted to the need of python interfacing.
